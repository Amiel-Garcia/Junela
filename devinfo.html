    <h2>Emman – Front-End Developer</h2>
<p>Speaks fluent Python but struggles with human conversation. Claims to love clean code but leaves comments like “idk why this works.” Debugs by staring at the screen until the problem fixes itself. </p>

<h5>"Can't Code. Can't Debug. Can't Read Pseudocode. But can pray it compiles."</h5>

<img src = "msc/images/amiel.png" height="200px" width="200px">
<h2>Amiel – Lead Front-End Developer</h2>
<p>Writes code that looks beautiful but breaks the moment you resize the window. Claims dark mode improves productivity but just likes the aesthetic. </p>

<h5>"If it works, don’t touch it. If it doesn’t work… still don’t touch it."</h5>


<img src = "msc/images/raf.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
<h2>Rafael – Project Manager</h2>
<p>Master of deadlines… mostly extending them. Talks about “agile workflow” but forgets to check his own tasks. Survives purely on coffee and last-minute miracles.</p>

<h5>"Let’s circle back on that… which means I have no idea what’s going on."</h5>
